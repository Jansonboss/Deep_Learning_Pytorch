    "\n",
    "At theoretical level, the embedding layer is a linear layer, there is not any difference at all. However, in practice, if you are building a deep learning software, you have to make a difference among them. This is because it does not make sense to apply an embedding layer using traditional matrix multiplication, as the input matrix is very sparse. For this reason, it is faster to do a look-up, although in terms of theory it is equivalent to doing a matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially everything. `[torch.nn.Embedding](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html)` is a lookup table; essentially works the same as `torch.Tensor` but with a few twists (like possibility to use sparse embedding or default value at specified index)."
